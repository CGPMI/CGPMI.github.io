<p>1 Timothy 1:12 "And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, <br/> for that He counted me faithful, putting me into ministry"
 Apostle Paul in his writings to his son Timothy the young Bishop,<br /> gave thanks to Jesus:</p>
 <ol>
<li><b> for the life of Timothy and for sustaining him through his ministry</b></li>
<li> for the calling of the young Bishop into the Lord's vineyard and <br/>not letting him die in sin.
God has a plan for everybody and His plans for our lives are unveiled in time.<br> Sometimes, He allows us to go through some things and at other times too He allows things come upon us.<br /> Any how it may be God's hand is in it not to destroy us, instead to work in us both to will and to do His good pleasure. 
In <i> Psalms 66:12 </i>. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; <br/> we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.</li>
</ol>

<b>The scripture clearly states that God has allowed</b>
<ol>
<li><b> Men to ride over our heads </b>. This realm is where men become the reason for everything you do and stand for.<br> You can't do without them</li>
<li><b> Going through fire</b>. Fire is a burning element that destroy whatever that comes it way. Hence our lives in fire means everything about us is burnt to destruction.</li>

<li> Going through water. That which the fire couldn't destroy is drowned by the waters and driven away. 
This result to a life of emptiness, retrogression and setbacks.<br/> And the interesting aspect of this journey is that God has allowed that to happen to us. Surprisingly when the tables turn the point four says. </li>
<li> God has brought us out into a wealthy place, <br />a place of abundance. Which is our rightful desirable place. And for one to come into this form we must go through the test of time. A test which will make you feel like God has ignored you. For Abraham to be Abraham, he has to pass the test of faithfulness. God can't trust what he has not tested.
Timothy was a gentile and that he was not qualified <br/>to be part of the Lord's people or have a share in God's glory but he was chosen to be the youngest Bishop in his days.<br /> In the same way, God is looking for an energetic young person to make a Bishop.
 Who will stand in the gap for the Lord to use?, as the eye of the Lord moves to and fro. Asking yourself this question will always bring you into the awareness of God's Purpose for your life.</li>
